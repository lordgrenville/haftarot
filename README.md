# Haftarot source data
Source data for weekly/holiday _haftarot_, since I couldn't find it easily online.

I took it from [here](https://www.shoresh.org.il/usersfiles/articlesdocs/parashot.pdf) and trimmed to just day, book, chapter. Where there are variations I followed the Ashkenazi custom to simplify - in most cases it doesn't matter much.
